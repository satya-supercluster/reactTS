        /**
         * Problem 5: Readonly and Const
         *
         * Description:
         * Create an interface User with readonly id and mutable name.
Show that id cannot be reassigned but name can.
Also demonstrate const with an object and how properties can still be modified.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * const user: User = { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * Changing user.id gives a TS error; changing user.name is allowed.
