         * Problem 1: Basic Type Annotations and Inference
         *
         * Description:
         * Create a function add(a, b) with proper TypeScript type annotations so that:
- It accepts only numbers
- It returns a number
Demonstrate how type inference works when assigning the result to a variable.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * add(2, 3)
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * 5 (and the variable holding this result is inferred as number)
