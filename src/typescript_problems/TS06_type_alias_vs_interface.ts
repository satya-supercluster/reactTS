         * Problem 6: Type Alias vs Interface
         *
         * Description:
         * Define a User using both type alias and interface with the same shape.
Extend the interface in another interface, and use intersection (&) with the type alias.
Demonstrate when you might prefer one vs the other.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * User with id:number, name:string, role:'admin'|'user'
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * Extended types/interfaces compile and can be used to create objects.
