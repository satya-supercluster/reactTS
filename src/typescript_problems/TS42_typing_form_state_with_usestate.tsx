         * Problem 42: Typing Form State with useState
         *
         * Description:
         * Create a login form component with state:
{ email: string; password: string; rememberMe: boolean }
Type the state and update functions so partial updates are handled safely.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * Update email field, check rememberMe.
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * State mutations are type-safe; wrong field names cause TS errors.
