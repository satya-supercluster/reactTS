         * Problem 48: Typing a Component that Integrates with an LLM API
         *
         * Description:
         * Create a <ChatBox> component that calls a mock LLM API function sendPrompt(prompt: string): Promise<ChatResponse>.
Define ChatResponse type and use it in component state.
Type the async handler and conditional rendering correctly.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * User types a prompt and clicks 'Send'.
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * Component shows loading, then response; all state is strongly typed.
