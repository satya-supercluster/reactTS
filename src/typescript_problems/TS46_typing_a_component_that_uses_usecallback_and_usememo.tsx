         * Problem 46: Typing a Component that Uses useCallback and useMemo
         *
         * Description:
         * Build a component that renders a list and uses:
- useCallback for a memoized item click handler
- useMemo for a derived filtered list
Type both hooks so the dependencies and returned values are strongly typed.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * Click items and see handler logs.
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * Handlers and memoized values are type-safe.
