         * Problem 22: Narrowing Error Types in Catch
         *
         * Description:
         * Write an async function that throws different kinds of errors (Error, custom error).
In the catch block, narrow the error type (e.g., using instanceof) before accessing properties.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * Call the function and trigger different failures.
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * Logs different messages based on error type with type safety.
