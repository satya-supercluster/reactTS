        /**
         * Problem 34: useState with Explicit and Inferred Types
         *
         * Description:
         * Create a component using useState for a count.
First, let TypeScript infer the type.
Then, use a more complex state (union or object) where explicit typing is required.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * count inferred as number; complex state requires explicit type parameter.
