         * Problem 16: Conditional Types Basics
         *
         * Description:
         * Define a conditional type IsString<T> that resolves to true if T is string, else false.
Test it with IsString<string>, IsString<number>.
Demonstrate via helper variables or comments.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * type A = IsString<string>; type B = IsString<number>;
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * A is true, B is false (as types).
