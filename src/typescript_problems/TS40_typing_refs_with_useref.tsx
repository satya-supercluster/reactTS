         * Problem 40: Typing Refs with useRef
         *
         * Description:
         * Create a component that focuses an input when a button is clicked.
Use useRef<HTMLInputElement | null> and correctly type the ref.
Show how to handle the initial null value safely.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * Click 'Focus' button.
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * Input gets focus; ref usage is fully typed.
