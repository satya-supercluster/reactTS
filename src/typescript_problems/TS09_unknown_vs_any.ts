         * Problem 9: Unknown vs Any
         *
         * Description:
         * Create a function processUnknown(value: unknown) that safely checks the type
before using it (e.g., if it's a string, log length; if it's a number, log square).
Explain in comments why unknown is safer than any.
         *
         * Sample Input:
         * processUnknown('hello'), processUnknown(5), processUnknown({})
         *
         * Sample Output:
         * Length: 5, Square: 25, 'Unsupported type' for object.
